Began as quick side experiment playing with Mapbox GL JS V2 (Sky + Terrain + Camera) following [launch announcement](https://www.mapbox.com/blog/mapbox-gl-js-v2-3d-maps-camera-api-sky-api-launch). Expanded to add photo gallery feature using Firebase Storage, Firestore, and Firebase Authentication for user accounts.

Feature list of things to get built, but basic functionality exists & has live users. Ready to scale to additional locations. Also reachable via embed at [Dirty Dozen Expeditions](https://thedirtydozenexpeditions.com/3d-map-of-truk-lagoon-dive-guide)
